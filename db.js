    "Winston Churchill" : "I have myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.",
    "Socrates" : "Some one will say: Yes, Socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue, and then you may go into a foreign city, and no one will interfere with you? Now I have great difficulty in making you understand my answer to this. For if I tell you that to do as you say would be a disobedience to the God, and therefore that I cannot hold my tongue, you will not believe that I am serious; and if I say again that daily to discourse about virtue, and of those other things about which you hear me examining myself and others, is the greatest good of man, and that the unexamined life is not worth living, you are still less likely to believe me.",
    "John F. Kennedy" : "There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one that we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.",
    "Emmeline Pankhurst": "You have left it to women in your land, the men of all civilised countries have left it to women, to work out their own salvation. That is the way in which we women of England are doing. Human life for us is sacred, but we say if any life is to be sacrificed it shall be ours; we won’t do it ourselves, but we will put the enemy in the position where they will have to choose between giving us freedom or giving us death.",
    "Abraham Lincoln" : "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",
    "Lee Kuan Yew" : "MR SPEAKER, Sir, may I say that the Government had put its cards on the table before it assumed office. We did it over three months of campaigning beginning from the famous day of 15th February at Hong Lim. It was there the Deputy Prime Minister said things and set off a chain reaction which finally ended with the routing of the rogues and scallywags that used to haunt this Chamber. We have placed before the people the mandate that we sought of them. We did not try to deceive anyone. We know exactly what is expected of us because we have made these promises. Unlike the previous government, we gave no hostages to fortune. Plainly and simply, we took the stand which we knew was necessary and in the interest of the survival of the democratic state in order, first, to cleanse the system of the evils of the past, and to retrieve some of the liberalism, the tolerance which were the good things we should carry into the future. I tell the Opposition this. They provide us, and I hope they will continue to provide us in the next five years, with that vivid contrast which will throw up the virtues of the PAP into magnificence.",
    "JK Rowling" : "[S]ome failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default. The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships until both have been tested by adversity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned.",
    "Michelle Obama" : "There will be days when you will worry about whether you’re really up for the challenge. Maybe some of you already feel a little of that right now. Maybe you’re wondering: Am I smart enough? Do I really belong? Can I live up to all those expectations that everyone has for me? Your best-laid plans will be consumed by obstacles, your excellent ideas will be peppered with flaws, you will be confronted with financial strains as your loans become due and salaries fall short of both expectations and expenses, you will make mistakes that will shatter your confidence, you will make compromises that will test your convictions, you will find that there is rarely a clear and direct path to any of your visions. Then you will find that you’ll have to readjust again and again and again. And there may be times when you wonder whether it’s all worth it. And there may be moments when you just want to quit. But in those moments, those inevitable moments, I urge you to think about this day. Look around you. There are thousands and thousands of hardworking people who have helped you get to this point, people who are celebrating with you today, who are praying for you every single day, and others who couldn’t be here, for whatever reason. I want you to think of the people who sacrificed for you-you know that — family members who worked a third job to get you through, who took on the extra shifts to get you through, who put off doing something important for themselves to get you to this day.",

    "Aragorn" : "Sons of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West!",
    "Rhett Butler" : "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.",
    "Some Valkyrie" : "May the gods of Asgard guide your steps towards their gates. In your journey, may it be safe and filled with light. May you find strength from Thor in your darkest hours. May you find wisdom from Odin in times of confusion. May you find beauty and lasting bonds from Freya and Frey. May your web be spun tightly with that which makes you stronger, happy, and wise. And may the gods always look upon you with good grace.",
    "Valedictorian Factory" : "A little over 12 years ago I was 6 and I remember my first day of school. I was excited with my new Power Rangers lunchbox. My parents were there with their camera, snapping pictures and wishing me well. And I met a really cool kid named James. In some ways not much has changed in 12 years. Here I am today. OK, so I didn't bring my Power Rangers lunchbox but, my parents are here with their camera, snapping pictures and wishing me well. My best friend James is here and he's still a really cool kid. And, I am excited. But this is how things are different. 12 years ago I was excited but I had no idea about the implications of the journey I was about to begin. I had no idea that after 1st grade there would be 2nd grade and 3rd grade and so on. I was just excited to be in first grade. Today, I know that I am standing on the brink of my future - the first day of the rest of my life. As a \"computer geek\" I am inspired by the words of one of our greatest American computer scientists, Alan Kay. He said, \"The greatest way to predict the future is to invent it.\" Some of us here today, including our parents, are wondering how our lives are going to turn out. It is OK to wonder but, I also think it is important to realize that our future is not just something that happens to us. It is up to us to create. So, fellow graduates, I urge you today to embrace the opportunity before you. Take what you have learned throughout the last 12 years and put it to good use. Leave behind what isn't helpful (I'm leaving my Power Rangers lunchbox) and bring forward with you the lessons that will be the working parts of your greatest invention ever, YOUR LIFE! Congratulations!",
